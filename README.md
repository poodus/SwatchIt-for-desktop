SwatchIt-for-desktop
====================

Desktop Java application (Processing based) to create a color swatched from an input image.

SwatchIt is a program which takes an image as input, then grabs a certain number of color samples from the image. You end up with this preview image (left) and a PDF of vectorized color swatches to easily aid in illustration, or graphic design that will match an image.

I was inspired to create this program after seeing the one Stefan Seigmeister describes in this TED talk (http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off.html) for his work with the Casa de Musica branding.
